## Part 1    PCA [30%]
Files you might want to look at for PCA:

```bash
datasets.py     Some simple toy data sets
digits          Digits data
util.py        Utility functions, plotting, etc.
```

Our first tasks are to implement PCA. If implemented correctly, these should be 5-line functions (plus the supporting code I've provided): just be sure to use numpy's eigenvalue computation code. Implement PCA in the function `pca` in `dr.py`.

The pseudo-code in Algorithm 37 in CIML demonstrates the role of covariance matrix in PCA. However, the implementation of covariance matrix in practice requires much more concerns. One of them is to decide whether we require an unbiased estimation of the covariance matrix, i.e. normalize D by (N-1) instead of N (biased). Even the popular packages, such as matlab and sklearn, differ in the implementation. To make things easy, we'll require the submitted code to implement an unbiased version. More references: [PCA tutorial](https://ourarchive.otago.ac.nz/esploro/outputs/report/A-tutorial-on-Principal-Components-Analysis/9926479584201891#file-0), [Sample mean and covariance.](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sample_mean_and_covariance). Using sklearn.decomposition.PCA or numpy.cov is prohibited. Read the comments in dr.py carefully.

### Qpca1 (15%) Implement PCA

Our first test of PCA will be on Gaussian data with a known covariance matrix. First, let's generate some data and see how it looks, and see what the sample covariance is:
```bash
>>> from numpy import *
>>> from matplotlib.pyplot import *
>>> import util
>>> Si = util.sqrtm(array([[3,2],[2,4]]))
>>> x = dot(random.randn(1000,2), Si)
>>> plot(x[:,0], x[:,1], 'b.')
>>> show(False)
>>> dot(x.T,x) / real(x.shape[0]-1) # The sample covariance matrix. Random generated data cause result to vary
array([[ 3.01879339,  2.07256783],
       [ 2.07256783,  4.15089407]])
```

(Note: The reason we have to do a matrix square-root on the covariance is because Gaussians are transformed by standard deviations, not by covariances.)

Note that the sample covariance of the data is almost exactly the true covariance of the data. If you run this with 100,000 data points (instead of 1000), you should get something even closer to `[[3,2],[2,4]]`.

Now, let's run PCA on this data. We basically know what should happen, but let's make sure it happens anyway (still, given the random nature, the numbers won't be exactly the same).
```bash
>>> import dr
>>> (P,Z,evals) = dr.pca(x, 2)
>>> Z
array([[-0.60270316, -0.79796548],
       [-0.79796548,  0.60270316]])
>>> evals
array([ 5.72199341,  1.45051781])
```
This tells us that the largest eigenvalue corresponds to the direction `[-0.603, -0.798]` and the second largest corresponds to the direction `[-0.798, 0.603]`. We can project the data onto the first eigenvalue and plot it in red, and the second eigenvalue in green. (Unfortunately we have to do some ugly reshaping to get dimensions to match up.)

```bash
>>> x0 = dot(dot(x, Z[:,0]).reshape(1000,1), Z[:,0].reshape(1,2))
>>> x1 = dot(dot(x, Z[:,1]).reshape(1000,1), Z[:,1].reshape(1,2))
>>> plot(x[:,0], x[:,1], 'b.', x0[:,0], x0[:,1], 'r.', x1[:,0], x1[:,1], 'g.')
>>> show(False)
``` 
Now, back to digits data. Let's look at some "eigendigits." (These numbers should be exact match)

```bash
>>> import datasets
>>> (X,Y) = datasets.loadDigits()
>>> (P,Z,evals) = dr.pca(X, 784)
>>> evals
array([ 0.05471459,  0.04324574,  0.03918324,  0.03075898,  0.02972407, .....
```

Eventually, the eigenvalues drop to zero (some may be negative due to floating point errors).

### Qpca2 (10%): Plot the normalized eigenvalues (include the plot in your writeup). How many eigenvectors do you have to include before you've accounted for 90% of the variance? 95%? (Hint: see function cumsum.)

Now, let's plot the top 50 eigenvectors:
```bash
>>> util.drawDigits(Z.T[:50,:], arange(50))
>>> show(False)
```
### Qpca3 (5%): Do these look like digits? Should they? Why or why not? (Include the plot in your write-up.) (Make sure you have got rid of the imaginary part in pca.)

## Part II    Softmax Regression [45%] 
Files to edit/turn in for this part 
```bash
softmax.py     
writeup.pdf
```

The goal of this part of the project is to implement Softmax Regression in order to classify the MNIST digit dataset. Softmax Regression is essentially a two-layer neural network where the output layer applies the Softmax cost function, a multiclass generalization of the logistic cost function.
In logistic regression, we have a hypothesis function of the form

$$ P[y = 1] = \frac{1}{1+e^{-\vec{w}\cdot\vec{x}}} $$

![p2](image-1.png)

where $$\vec{w}$$  is our weight vector. Like the hyperbolic tangent function, the logistic function is also a sigmoid function with the characteristic 's'-like shape, though it has a range of (0, 1) instead of (-1, 1). Note that this is
technically not a classifier since it returns probabilities instead of a predicted class, but it's easy to turn it into a classifier by simply choosing the class with the highest probability.

Since logistic regression is used for binary classification, it is easy to see that:
![p22](image-2.png)
$$ \begin{align*}
P[y = 1] &= \frac{1}{1+e^{-\vec{w}\cdot\vec{x}}} \\&= \frac{e^{\vec{w}\cdot\vec{x}}}{e^{\vec{w}\cdot\vec{x}}+1} \\&= \frac{e^{\vec{w}\cdot\vec{x}}}{e^{\vec{w}\cdot\vec{x}}+e^{\vec{0}\cdot\vec{x}}}
\end{align*} $$

Similarly,
![p23](image-3.png)

$$\begin{align*}
P[y = 0] &= 1 - \frac{1}{1+e^{-\vec{w}\cdot\vec{x}}} \\
&= \frac{e^{\vec{w}\cdot\vec{x}}+1}{e^{\vec{w}\cdot\vec{x}}+1} - \frac{e^{\vec{w}\cdot\vec{x}}}{e^{\vec{w}\cdot\vec{x}}+1} \\
&= \frac{e^{\vec{0}\cdot\vec{x}}}{e^{\vec{w}\cdot\vec{x}}+e^{\vec{0}\cdot\vec{x}}}
\end{align*}$$

From this form it appears that we can assign the vector $$\vec{w_1} = \vec{w}$$ as the weight vector for class 1 and $$\vec{w_0} = \vec{0}$$ as the weight vector for class 0. Our probability formulas are now unified into one equation:
![p24](image-4.png)
$$P[y = i] = \frac{e^{\vec{w_i}\cdot\vec{x}}}{\sum_{j}e^{\vec{w_j}\cdot\vec{x}}} $$


This immediately motivates generalization to classification with more than 2 classes. By assigning a separate weight vector $$\vec{w_i}$$ to each class, for each example $$\vec{x}$$ we can predict the probability that it is class i, and again we can classify by choosing the most probable class. A more compact way of representing the values $$\vec{w_i}\cdot\vec{x}$$ is $$W \vec{x}$$ where each row i of W is $$\vec{w_i}$$. We can also represent a dataset $$\vec{x_i}$$  with a matrix `X` where each column is a single example.

### Qsr1 (10%)
(1) Show that the probabilities sum to 1. 
(2) What are the dimensions of `W`? `X`? `WX`? 
We can also train on this model with an appropriate loss function. The Softmax loss function is given by
$$L(W) = -\left[ \sum_{i=1}^{m} \sum_{k=1}^{K} 1\left\{y_i = k\right\} \log \frac{e^{\vec{w_k}\cdot \vec{x_i}}}{\sum_{j=1}^K e^{\vec{w_j}\cdot \vec{x_i}}}\right]$$
![p25](image-5.png)
where `m`is the number of examples, `k`is the number of classes, and $$ 1\left\{y_i = k\right\}$$ is an indicator variable that equals 1 when the statement inside the brackets is true, and 0 otherwise. The gradient (which you will not derive) is given by:
![p26](image-6.png)
$$\nabla_{\vec{w_k}} L(W) = -\sum_{i=1}^{m}{ \left[ \vec{x_i} \left( 1\{y_i = k\} - P[y_i = k]\right) \right]}$$

Note that the indicator and the probabilities can be represented as matrices, which makes the code for the loss and the gradient very simple. ([See here](http://ufldl.stanford.edu/tutorial/supervised/SoftmaxRegression/) for more details)

softmax.py contains a mostly-complete implementation of Softmax Regression. A code stub also has been provided in run_softmax.py. Once you correctly implement the incomplete portions of softmax.py, you will be able to run run_softmax.py in order to classify the MNIST digits.

### Qsr2 (15%)

(1) Complete the implementation of the cost function.
(2) Complete the implementation of the predict function.

Check your implementation by running:
```bash
>>> python run_softmax.py
```

The output should be:

### Qsr3 (10%)

In the cost function, we see the line
```bash
W_X = W_X - np.max(W_X)
```
This means that each entry is reduced by the largest entry in the matrix.
(1) Show that this does not affect the predicted probabilities.
(2) Why might this be an optimization over using W_X? Justify your answer.

### Qsr4 (10%)


Use the learningCurve function in runClassifier.py to plot the accuracy of the classifier as a function of the number of examples seen. Include the plot in your write-up. Do you observe any overfitting or underfitting? Discuss and expain what you observe.
